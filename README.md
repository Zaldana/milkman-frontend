Milkman will emulate an eCommerce site used to purchase milk that will be delivered to the user's home.

The products will be pulled from the Kroger public API which has over 1800 milk products.

The store will be divided in four categories:
Natural & Organic
Non-Dairy
Flavored
Barrista Selections (for coffee)

The Backend will be created using Express and have a user model.

The Frontend will be created with React and the Redux to manage the user state, the shopping cart state, and the products database state pulled from kroger API.

MUI will be used for the site styles.
